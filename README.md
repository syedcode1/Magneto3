# MAGNETO v3 - Advanced APT Campaign Simulator

**Version 3** - October 2025

## Overview

MAGNETO is a professional-grade **Living Off The Land (LOLBin)** attack simulation framework designed for security professionals, penetration testers, red teams, and SOC analysts. Built exclusively with native Windows binaries and PowerShell, MAGNETO provides a comprehensive suite of MITRE ATT&CK techniques without requiring any external dependencies, third-party tools, or additional installations.

## Why MAGNETO is Unique

### üéØ 100% Living Off The Land (LOLBin)

MAGNETO exclusively leverages **legitimate Windows binaries** and built-in system tools that exist natively on every Windows installation:

- **No external executables** - Uses only Microsoft-signed binaries (certutil.exe, rundll32.exe, regsvr32.exe, wmic.exe, etc.)
- **No third-party dependencies** - No Python, no .NET assemblies, no PowerShell modules to install
- **No compilation required** - Pure PowerShell scripts that run out-of-the-box
- **Authentic threat simulation** - Mirrors real-world APT tradecraft that evades traditional signature-based detection

### ‚ö° Lightweight & Self-Contained

- **Zero installation footprint** - Extract and run immediately
- **< 2MB total size** - All scripts combined are smaller than most executables
- **Portable** - Run from USB, network share, or any directory without system modifications
- **No prerequisites** - Works on any Windows 10/11 system with PowerShell 5.0+

### üìä Comprehensive Coverage

From basic reconnaissance to advanced persistence mechanisms:

- **Simple techniques** - Network discovery, file enumeration, process listing
- **Intermediate techniques** - Registry persistence, scheduled tasks, WMI queries
- **Advanced techniques** - Process injection patterns, token manipulation, alternate data streams
- **Complete attack chains** - Pre-configured APT campaign simulations with realistic TTPs

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from GitHub
2. Extract all files to a folder
3. **Add antivirus exclusion** (see below)
4. Run `Launch_MAGNETO_v3.bat` as Administrator

### System Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- PowerShell 5.0 or higher
- Administrator privileges (recommended)
- .NET Framework 4.5+

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Antivirus Exclusion Required

**YOU MAY NEED TO ADD ANTIVIRUS EXCLUSIONS BEFORE RUNNING MAGNETO**

MAGNETO is a **legitimate cybersecurity testing tool** used by security professionals for authorized penetration testing and red team exercises. Antivirus software **will block MAGNETO** because it simulates real attack techniques.

### Common Error Messages

If you see these errors, you need to add exclusions:

```
‚ùå "This script contains malicious content and has been blocked by your antivirus software"
‚ùå "Heur.BZC.ZFV.Boxter.1069.A73FD735 detected"
‚ùå "Technique section is empty"
‚ùå "Error loading techniques"
```

Add the entire MAGNETO installation folder to your antivirus exclusion/whitelist list. Consult your antivirus documentation for "How to add exclusions" or "How to whitelist files."

### Why Does MAGNETO Trigger Antivirus?

MAGNETO is a **red team tool** that simulates real-world attack techniques:

- ‚úÖ **Registry modifications** - Simulates persistence mechanisms
- ‚úÖ **Process injection patterns** - Tests EDR detection
- ‚úÖ **Network reconnaissance** - Simulates C2 communications
- ‚úÖ **Credential access techniques** - Tests security monitoring
- ‚úÖ **LOLBin execution** - Uses legitimate Windows binaries

These are **intentional, authorized security testing behaviors** used by:
- Penetration testers
- Red teams
- SOC analysts
- Security researchers
- SIEM/EDR vendors

**This is the SAME reason tools like Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, and Atomic Red Team are flagged.**

### Verification After Adding Exclusion

After adding the exclusion:

1. **Restart MAGNETO** or reboot your computer
2. Launch `Launch_MAGNETO_v3.bat`
3. You should see:
   ```
   [+] MAGNETO GUI v3 initialized
   [+] Found MAGNETO_v3.ps1 in script directory
   [>] Loading techniques from MAGNETO v3 script...
   [+] Loaded 38 techniques successfully
   ```
4. The **Technique List** in GUI should show all 38 techniques

### Still Having Issues?

If exclusions don't work:

1. **Temporarily disable antivirus** (not recommended for production systems)
2. **Run MAGNETO in a VM** (recommended for testing environments)
3. **Contact your antivirus vendor** and explain it's a legitimate security testing tool
4. **Check GitHub Issues**: https://github.com/syedcode1/Magneto3/issues

## Usage

### GUI Mode (Recommended)

```batch
Launch_MAGNETO_v3.bat
```

The GUI provides:
- Technique selection and filtering
